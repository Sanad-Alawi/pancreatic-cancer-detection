# üß¨ Pancreatic Cancer Detection

This project explores **early detection of pancreatic cancer** using urinary biomarker data.  
It applies a wide range of **machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models**, including traditional algorithms and **TabPFN**, with a focus on accuracy, cross-validation, and explainability (XAI).
